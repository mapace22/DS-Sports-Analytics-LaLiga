# DS | Sports Analytics: Performance Modeling (La Liga)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a sports analytics framework to evaluate player efficiency during the Spanish La Liga season (2020-2021). The core focus is transforming raw data into **Efficacy KPIs (EKPIs)** and ensuring data integrity—a critical competency for training and validating AI models.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.11.9
* **Key Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy (Vectorized operations), Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* **Methodology:** Data Auditing, Feature Engineering, and Descriptive Statistical Analysis.

## 🚀 Technical Highlights
1. **Computational Efficiency:** Leveraged **NumPy vectorized operations** for metric calculations, ensuring scalable and high-performance data processing.
2. **Data Quality Audit (AI Readiness):** Implemented logical validation layers to detect inconsistencies in performance records (e.g., Goals vs. Shots), demonstrating high attention to data reliability.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Developed the **EKPI index** (Goals+Assists/Minutes) to normalize player impact regardless of time on the pitch, providing a more accurate performance benchmark.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `data/`: Contains the original sports performance datasets.
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks documenting the full ETL, auditing, and visualization workflow.
* `.gitignore`: Configuration to exclude temporary and local system files.
